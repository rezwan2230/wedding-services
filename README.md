# Answer 
1. C. Undefined    
// in this code, gretting is a a empty object. so when we print it, it show undefined

2. C. "12"         
// here we give 2 argument, one is integer and another is string. so when we want to add it They cannot add normally, they sit side by side

3. A. ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']
//There is no modification in food array, so when we print it, it print it's food array values..

4. B: Hi there, undefined
// sayHi() function has a parameter, so when we call it we should give a argument. but here, no argument given, so name variable didnot store anything. thats why it prints  Hi there, undefined..

5. C: 3
// here, count variable initialize with zero. then apply a loop for "num" array and set a condition, if the num array element is true then increment-1 int the count value. in this array, the first element is zero, so statement can't go in if statement for the others element count value increase 1 by one. so final result is 3.
